The space I want to move in seems filled with pockets of higher density that articulate the gaps. These pockets are dense but are pulled apart into hollows by the tensions that exist in this space. These tensions are just there, and my body, when its next movement is considered carefully, will follow the paths carved out by them. One of these denser areas is always around my stomach or chest, or rather where my elbows or upper arms meet my these. The movement then flows out of arms, pushed away from this thickness out into emptier space but towards another floating cluster of tendons.
The arms arrive, and it is always an elbow or a wrist, or even a shoulder, that must rise to touch this cluster, from which other tendons stretch out, pulled in different directions. To follow another, the joint must twist and carry the body in this torsion, as this is the only way for the insufficiently pliable arm to be following both the original pull and the second, resulting pull at the same time. These twists allow the fiction, that my arm, still attached to my body, can flow through these veins, to be maintained.
